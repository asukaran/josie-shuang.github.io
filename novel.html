					<p>I am writing a book of a detective story occurring during the last years before the collaspe of 
              				Ming Dynasty in ancient China. This story is not only about schemes, deceits, and confrontations, 
				      but is more of a portray of the civilians and lower-class officials and their struggles, conflicts, 
				      and faiths in the turbulent world in late Ming. <br/>
				      The main characters: 
				<ul>
					    <li>Su the Southern Star (the main character): A lower-class official in the Imperial guards.</li>
					    <li>You Demand on the Wind: Su's assistant. </li>
					    <li>Xu the Grace: The 5th daughter of a previleged officer. A hostage of the seven thieves. </li>
					    <li>Catch the clouds: A mysterious assassin. </li>
					    <li>The seven thieves: The remnant soldiers after the death of the rebel leader Gao Yingxiang. </li>
				</ul>
				    Still working on it...
