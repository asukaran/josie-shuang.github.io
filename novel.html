					<p>I am writing a Chinese detective novel in the background of the last decade before the collaspe of 
              				Ming Dynasty in ancient China (~1630s). This is not only a story replete with crimes, schemes, and confrontations, 
				      but is more a portrait of the struggles, distress, and faiths of the lower-class officials and civilians in the 
					turbulent and chaotic world at war in late Ming. <br/><br/>
				      The main characters: 
				<ul>
					    <li>Su (the main character): A lower-class official in the Imperial guards.</li>
					    <li>You: Su's assistant, also a lower-cass official in the Imperial guards. </li>
					    <li>Miss Xu: A young daughter of a previleged officer. A hostage of the seven thieves. </li>
					    <li>Cloud: A mysterious killer. </li>
					    <li>The seven thieves: The remnant soldiers after the death of the rebel leader Gao Yingxiang. </li>
				</ul>
				    Still working on it...
